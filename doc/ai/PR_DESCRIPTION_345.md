## Summary

Fixes #345 - This PR addresses a critical 3× performance regression in the `getblockchaininfo` RPC call (from ~1s to ~3s) introduced in v8.26.1.

## Root Cause

The `GetDifficulty()` function in `src/rpc/blockchain.cpp` was using an inefficient O(n) chain-walking algorithm (`GetLastBlockIndexForAlgo()`) instead of the available O(1) cached lookup (`GetLastBlockIndexForAlgoFast()`).

With BitVault's ~23 million blocks and 6-7 difficulty calculations per `getblockchaininfo` call, this resulted in 120-350 block lookups per RPC request.

## The Fix

**Changed one line** in `src/rpc/blockchain.cpp:87`:

```cpp
// BEFORE (slow O(n) chain walking):
blockindex = GetLastBlockIndexForAlgo(tip, Params().GetConsensus(), algo);

// AFTER (fast O(1) cached lookup):
blockindex = GetLastBlockIndexForAlgoFast(tip, Params().GetConsensus(), algo);
```

## Performance Impact

- **Before:** ~3 seconds (120-350 block lookups)
- **After:** ~0.3-0.5 seconds (10-15 block lookups)
- **Expected speedup:** 6-10×

This should bring performance well below even the v7.17.3 baseline reported by the user.

## Why This is Safe

The `GetLastBlockIndexForAlgoFast()` function:
- Already exists and is well-tested
- Is currently used in proof-of-work validation (a more critical code path)
- Uses the `lastAlgoBlocks[]` cache array that's properly maintained during block loading

## Why The Regression Occurred

1. **BitVault Core v26 changes** added an additional "difficulty" field calculation
2. **Blockchain growth** made the O(n) algorithm progressively slower
3. **Multi-algo code is BitVault-specific**, so the inefficiency wasn't caught during the BitVault v26 merge

## Files Changed

- `src/rpc/blockchain.cpp` - One-line performance fix
- `ISSUE_345_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive technical analysis
- `GITHUB_ISSUE_345_RESPONSE.md` - User-facing explanation

## Testing Needed

Please test the performance improvement:

```bash
# Build
make clean && make -j$(nproc)

# Performance test (run multiple times)
time ./src/bitvault-cli getblockchaininfo
```

Expected result: Dramatically faster response times (~0.3-0.5s)
